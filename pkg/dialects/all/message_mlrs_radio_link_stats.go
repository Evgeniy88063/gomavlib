// Radio link statistics for a MAVLink RC receiver or transmitter and other links. Tx: ground-side device, Rx: vehicle-side device.
// The message is normally emitted in regular time intervals upon each actual or expected reception of an over-the-air data packet on the link.
// A MAVLink RC receiver should emit it shortly after it emits a RADIO_RC_CHANNELS message (if it is emitting that message).
// Per default, rssi values are in MAVLink units: 0 represents weakest signal, 254 represents maximum signal, UINT8_MAX represents unknown.
// The RADIO_LINK_STATS_FLAGS_RSSI_DBM flag is set if the rssi units are negative dBm: 1..254 correspond to -1..-254 dBm, 0 represents no reception, UINT8_MAX represents unknown.
// The target_system field should normally be set to the system id of the system the link is connected to, typically the flight controller.
// The target_component field can normally be set to 0, so that all components of the system can receive the message.
// Note: The frequency fields are extensions to ensure that they are located at the end of the serialized payload and subject to MAVLink's trailing-zero trimming.
