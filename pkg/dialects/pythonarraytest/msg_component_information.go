// Component information message, which may be requested using MAV_CMD_REQUEST_MESSAGE.

// This contains MAVLink FTP URIs for the component's general and peripherals metadata files along with their CRCs (which can be used for file caching).
// The files must be hosted on the component, and may be xz compressed.
// The general metadata file can be read to get the locations of additional metadata files (COMP_METADATA_TYPE), which may be hosted either on the vehicle or the Internet.
// For more information see: https://mavlink.io/en/services/component_information.html.

// Note: Camera components should use CAMERA_INFORMATION instead, and autopilots may use both this message and AUTOPILOT_VERSION.
